# Chicago-Metropolitan-Area-Crash-Visualization

Data visualization and analysis project developed in sophomore year at Northwestern University for an end-of-quarter school project. Uses pandas, numpy, matplotlib, geopandas, shapely, and other Python data visualization and formatting tools. Analyzes and visualizes associations between city districts, weather conditions, and speed limits with car crash frequencies and deadliness. 

Data sourced from [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Traffic-Crashes-Crashes/85ca-t3if/about_data) and [other personal datascraping project](https://github.com/RyanShen28/Wunderground_Scraper/tree/main).
